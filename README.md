Resources used: Various images from google image search.

Main class file: Main.java

Data (non Java) files needed: All of them

How to play the game: Use the arrow keys to avoid obstacles and collect powerups! Try to make it just over 3 miles to Taco Bell...

```sh
javac ./*.java -d bin
java -classpath bin:. Main
```

Known bugs: Player can cheat by moving offscreen. There is a hard to reproduce bug with the arrow keys' input. 

Extra features: The game CAN in fact be beat without cheating.

Impressions/Suggestions: I enjoyed the project, but didn't manage my time well. It's always the small things (ex. 45min to figure out splash screen)
